# Introduction-to-QuantativeFinance
Very basic introduction to quantative finance and programming it in java, includes basic notes in headers at the top of java files. 

Here we mostly focus on building basic portfolio which include shares/assets, bonds and derivatives though is limited in programming 
and more focused on those who wish to learn the mathematics behind quantative finance. For anyone interested in learning about 
Quantative Finance I'd recommend, An introduction to Quantative Finance by Blyth, which is where I was able to require most of my notes,
though later on I may create my own notes to upload which are taylored to the aspects of finance included in this program aswell.
